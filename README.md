# JavaScriptTemplate

### This is my status on learning JavaScript that will include everything I learn on it's syntax so I can reference it back.

Not the best look in design or logic for coding, but works as a template pretty well on how things work. There will also my initial projects too.

### This Template serves more as a reference for those times where I forget what does what. I will not need to go Google it but look at here first. 

## This JavaScript Template will also include jQuery soon as well.
